# Siek-Communicatie
Source code of the website [www.siek-communicatie.nl](https://siek-communicatie.paradoxis.nl), built in February of 2015 with PhalconPHP. 
The website is now hosted at [siek-communicatie.paradoxis.nl](https://siek-communicatie.paradoxis.nl), the administrative panel has been disabled for security reasons.

## The project
SIEK communicatie was a project set up by six students from the Hogeschool Leiden. 
The goal was to set up a company in a limited amount of time to organize events and other activities and won an award for the best project of the year.

The name SIEK is an abbreviation for 'Success Is Een Keuze' (success is a choice). 
The website was designed and programmed single handedly by [Luke Paris (Paradoxis)](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/paradoxis) within four days entirely from scratch, and gave the team a big boost as part of their social media campaign.
